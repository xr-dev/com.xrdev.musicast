I have similar problem as jimvonmoon, incl. warnings...:
warning: while parsing target library list (at line 2): No segment defined for /system/bin/linker
warning: Could not load shared library symbols for ...

I think I found a workaround for this.

After launch for each breakpoint already set i saw only:
> No symbol table is loaded.  Use the "file" command.

- after the application was launched, my library loaded, and running i paused app_process in eclipse debugger perspective
- checked that my thread do not have source code attached - addresses only
- given 

> set solib-search-path ./obj/local/armeabi
> file ./obj/local/armeabi/app_process
as input for [Android Native Application Console] view

output was:
warning: while parsing target library list (at line 2): No segment defined for my.package.name
warning: Could not load shared library symbols for libjnigraphics.so.
Do you need "set solib-search-path" or "set sysroot"?
warning: Unable to find dynamic linker breakpoint function.
GDB will be unable to debug shared library initializers
and track explicitly loaded dynamic code.

A program is being debugged already.
Are you sure you want to change the file? (y or n) [answered Y; input not from terminal]
Load new symbol table from PATH_TO_MY_PROJECT/obj/local/armeabi/app_process"? (y or n) [answered Y; input not from terminal]
Reading symbols from PATH_TO_MY_PROJECT/obj/local/armeabi/app_process...done.

WARNING: no debugging symbols found in PATH_TO_MY_PROJECT/obj/local/armeabi/app_process.
Either the binary was compiled without debugging information
or the debugging information was removed (e.g., with strip or strip -g).
Debugger capabilities will be very limited.

- resumed process
- previously set breakpoint automatically stopped execution or (if no breakpoint set) pause it again manually, and as for now it looks fine, i have source code, basic debugging seems to work
